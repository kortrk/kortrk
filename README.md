With 6 years of professional experience in object-oriented programming and data management, I acclimatize to new challenges smoothly. I get a kick out of writing elegant code. I’m an avid documenter, and am arguably happiest when communicating: building ideas and relationships with others. Ultimately, though I write code, it’s working with and for people that keeps me energetic and passionate.
